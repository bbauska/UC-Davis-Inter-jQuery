        EVERY one in the CIA/FBI/NSA who possess these lies yet doesn't announce them, is in turn
        a liar & thief & accomplice to murder.  Started a 'cold war' in order to cover their f??king

        "We knew the world would not be the same. Few people laughed, few people cried, most people were silent. 
        I remembered the line from the Hindu scripture, the Bhagavad Gita: Vishnu was trying to persuade the 
        prince that he should do his duty, and to impress him, takes on his multi-armed form and says, 
        'Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.' I suppose we all felt that, one way or another."

        The turning point for America came with Ronald Reagan. With the help of Lee Atwater 
        and Karl Rove, they started the tribalism movement that now engulfs the nation. 
        They used hate to create an “us versus them” mentality that is only growing worse. 
        Reagan single handedly disabled the union movement and convinced his tribe that 
        their taxes should not be used to help individuals unworthy of help. He also 
        energized the cabal of bankers and Wall Street investors along with the top 1% 
        to venture into the political arena in a major way. President Reagan also convinced 
        Americans that private industries always do a better job than government. This is 
        an extremely dangerous principle to sell. Private industry is only interested in 
        profit, not the people they serve. That's why private prisons are failing so badly 
        in this country. They have actually bribed Judges to give extended sentences in 
        order to increase profits. Private security such as Blackwater have been involved 
        in numerous transgressions. Private schools serve only the wealthiest individuals 
        in our society and currently they are attempting to get their hands on government 
        funds. If a public agency is not meeting the needs of the people, we have guarantees 
        in place to correct their deficiencies. We do not have the same oversight on private 
        companies. I think most of us would agree that the U.S. Military creates the finest 
        soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines in the world. Please note that it's government 
        run. If you disagree with that, I'll gladly accompany you to Camp Lejeune were you 
        can express your opinion to the young Marines there.

      President George H.W. Bush then pushed through the necessary paperwork to create 
      Fox news and the talk show phenomenon. This created a Propaganda outlet that drew 
      the wealthiest individuals into the political process in a much more overt way. 
      With all this new money, the Republican Party subverted the southern States by 
      using subliminal racism to gain control of their legislative systems. With that 
      control they began to gerrymander their Congressional districts to insure continued 
      control of the State governments and the U.S. House of Representatives. They realized, 
      however, that other methods had to be enacted since they were losing the demographic 
      race. To try and negate this trend, they passed bills that complicated or made 
      difficult minority voting.

        To enforce these laws, which were of questionable legality, the Reactionary 
        Republicans needed to ensure the support of the national courts. Sen. McConnell 
        began this procedure by making all of President Obama's judicial appointments 
        difficult by using the 60% rule and stalling his nominations. He also colluded 
        to change the fundamental makeup of the U.S. Supreme Court.

        Now we come to the culmination of all those maneuvers. We have Donald Trump as 
        President. He single handedly gutted attempts to attack global warming. He 
        has alienated what has historically been America's closest allies, and he has 
        endangered the effectiveness of NATO. He has started a trade war that many 
        economists warn as extremely dangerous to the American economy. He has convinced 
        Americans to give the wealthiest individuals a huge tax break while convincing 
        them that helping the poor just enables slackers. He has managed to reduce 
        medical care in this country claiming he had a better solution. He just hasn't 
        gotten around to implementing it yet while millions have lost coverage. He has 
        taken credit for programs implemented by President Obama that saved the economy 
        after the disasters created under President George W. Bush. He has boasted about 
        groping and molesting women. His neglect created a human disaster in Puerto Rico. 
        He has allowed Russian interference to sway an american election. He has impugned 
        the reputation of the American intelligence community. He has convinced his followers 
        that any news he doesn't like is “fake news”, and that he is the only reliable 
        source of information that Americans can trust. He is personally profiting from 
        being President, and he is guilty of nepotism.
