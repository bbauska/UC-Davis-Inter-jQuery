The &lt;head&gt; of an HTML document is the part that is not displayed in the web browser when the page is loaded. It contains information such 
as the page <b>title</b>, links to glossary("CSS")
(if you choose to style your HTML content with CSS), links to custom favicons, and other metadata (data about the HTML, such as the author, and 
important keywords that describe the document). Web browsers use information contained in the {&lt;head&gt;  to render the HTML document correctly. 
In this article we'll cover all of the above and more, in order to give you a good basis for working with markup.

<h3>About this Course</h3>

This course is the third in our JavaScript for Beginners Specialization. The scripts will become more complex and introduce more complex jQuery 
plugins. You will have several challenges to practice your skills throughout the course. The course objectives include how to identify objects 
in JavaScript; create new objects and populate them with data; manipulate objects by adding, modifying and deleting data in objects; manipulate 
the DOM based on the data in objects; identify and articulate how multiple functions work together to create a more complex program; and identify 
processes for breaking larger programs into smaller, more manageable pieces.
